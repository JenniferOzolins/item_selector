# Item Selector for Flutter

A generic [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) item selector that works with
ListView, GridView, Row, Column, or basically any parent widget that
can have indexed child widgets. It supports single-selection by tap,
and multi-selection by long-press and drag with auto-scrolling.

## Usage

To use this package, add `item_selector` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

## Thanks

Item Selector is based on [Multi Select GridView in Flutter - by Simon Lightfoot](https://gist.github.com/slightfoot/a002dd1e031f5f012f810c6d5da14a11).
